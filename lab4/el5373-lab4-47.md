## 4.7 Routing experiments with ICMP

For this experiment, we will reuse the same network as in the previous experiment. 

Set up "romeo" so that it uses Router 1 (10.10.61.1) as its gateway for the 10.10.0.0/16 network, and set up "petruchio" so that it uses Router 4 (10.10.64.4) as its gateway for the 10.10.0.0/16 network. These hosts are only hop apart by the shortest path, but using these routes, this path includes an extra hop. Save the routing table on both workstations.

On one workstation in each network segment, run

```
sudo tcpdump -enx -i eth1 -w $(hostname -s)-redirect-1.pcap
```

Then, `ping` from "romeo" to "petruchio". On "romeo", run

```
ping 10.10.64.100
```

After capturing an ICMP redirect message, save the `ping` output and stop the ping.

On "romeo", run

```
traceroute 10.10.64.100
```

and save the output. Also, stop the `tcpdump` processes.

By default, our workstations will not apply the routes suggested by the ICMP redirect message. To enable those routes, run

```
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects=1
```

on "romeo". Restart the `tcpdump` processes on each segment, but write to a new file, with

```
sudo tcpdump -enx -i eth1 -w $(hostname -s)-redirect-2.pcap
```

Then, run 

```
ping 10.10.64.100
```

again on romeo until you see an ICMP redirect. Stop the ping and run

```
traceroute 10.10.64.100
```

and save the output. Then, stop the `tcpdump` processes.

**Lab report**: Identify every field in the ICMP redirect message that you captured (see Fig. 4.2).

**Lab report**: Show the `traceroute` output before and after the ICMP redirect instruction was applied, and explain the change.

**Lab report**: From the tcpdump output, explain how the multi-hop route was found using `traceroute`. Explain the sequence of the ICMP messages used.
