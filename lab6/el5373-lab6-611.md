## 6.11 Other TCP exercises

For this experiment, we will reuse the same network as in the [previous experiment](el5373-lab6-67.md).

### Exercise 7

Run an `iperf3` server on "juliet", if one is not already running:

```
iperf3 -s
```

On "romeo", start a `tcpdump` with

```
sudo tcpdump -S -s 68 -i eth1 -w tcp-fragmentation-$(hostname -s).pcap
```

While `tcpdump` is running to capture traffic between "romeo" and "juliet", execute the following command, which is similar to the command we used to find out the maximum size of a UDP datagram in Chapter 5, on "romeo":

```
iperf3 -c 10.10.2.100 -l 70000 -n 70000
```

Note that we use a size that is larger than the maximum UDP datagram size we found in Exercise 5 of Chapter 5. 

**Lab report**: Did you observe any IP fragmentation? If IP fragmentation did not occur this time, how do you explain this compared to what you observed in [Section 5.6](/lab5/el5373-lab5-56.md)?
